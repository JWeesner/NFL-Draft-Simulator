# NFL-Draft-Simulator

Tired of using Google spreadsheets to do mock drafts. Other mock draft sims are only 1 person and have poor realism when it comes to team needs and trade values. First iteration will be single player, no sign-ins required, with second iteration allowing 32 individuals to control each team and create a genuine mock draft experience.
